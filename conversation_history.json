It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n\nMachine Learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on input data, known as \"training data,\" and use that model to make predictions or decisions without being specifically programmed to perform the task.\n\nThere are three main types of Machine Learning:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The algorithm learns to map input data to output data based on the examples provided. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on an unlabeled dataset. They are used for tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Autoencoders.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward. The agent learns from trial and error by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\nThere are also hybrid approaches that combine elements of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, such as semi-supervised learning and active learning."

The labeled examples, or training data, consist of input data and the corresponding output, also known as the target variable.\n\nThe goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen input data. This function, or model, is learned by minimizing the error between the predicted output and the true output for the training data.\n\nThere are different types of supervised learning, such as:\n\n1. **Classification**: The input data is categorized into one of several classes. For example, classifying an email as spam or not spam.\n\n2. **Regression**: The input data is continuous and the goal is to predict a continuous output. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its features.\n\nSome popular algorithms used for supervised learning include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\n\nThe quality of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error (MSE) for classification and regression tasks, respectively. These metrics help assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn summary, supervised learning is a powerful tool for building models that can accurately predict output for new input data based on labeled examples. It is widely used in various applications such as image classification, text classification, and regression analysis."
